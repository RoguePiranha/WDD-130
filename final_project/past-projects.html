                        <p>Iconic Arizona is a clothing brand based out of Phoenix, Arizona. They have amazing products and we were excited to be able to deliver a website that matched the level of their brand. This site was the first one that I ever worked on and was built on Shopify.</p>

                        <p>Static Sun Electric and Solar is owned by some friends of mine. Their original website was built years ago and not maintained. The big thing here was keeping their colors, while toning them down to not be overwhelming. Their new site was built in Squarespace.</p>

                        <p>This was a fun site to build. Lifetime Leather had a big presence on Etsy already selling leather products and wanted to have a Shopify site that would help them broaden their markets. We went through a few different iterations of the site as new options became available, and the final product turned out amazing.</p>

                        <p>Clean with HoCl has a focus on a single product, which is their Hypochlorous Acid solution, for use as a cleaning product replacement. We built their site with a focus on that single product and how we could more effectively engage their target audience. This was built in Shopify.</p>
