      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>One of the most important things to be able to show as a designer or developer is work that you’ve done in the past. By having a good portfolio, it allows potential employers or clients to see not only the quality of your work, but it also helps them to get a feel for your personal style and tastes.
        What I would like to make for my final web project is a web portfolio. A site dedicated to the work that I’ve completed or projects that I’m working on. I spent two years as a Web Designer and have a lot to show for it, but If I don’t have a place where it gets showcased, then it might as well not have happened. 
        My homepage would talk about the services that I’ve rendered and the experience that I’ve gained. It would include highlights of some of my best work in a way that really gives site visitors a general understanding of my expertise. 
        On another page, I’ll go into more detail on the projects that I’ve done. I’ll include more information on things like what it was for, what went right, what I learned, etc. I will try to pick projects that cover a wide range of different skills that I’ve had to employ and develop.
        On the third page of the site, it will be a contact page with a way to contact me if a person wants me to do work for them. I would also like to include a form where they can give general details and select the kind of project, they would like me to help them with.
        </p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will primarily be future employers or clients depending on how things shake out with that. I assume that they'll be people in the same industry, although they may or may not have actual experience in the field, so I will need to be specific and clear about the projects that I include and the scope of the work involved.</p>  <!-- change this -->
