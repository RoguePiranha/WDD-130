                        <p>As a Front-End Web Developer with Swello, I work primarily with Squarespace and Shopify, but
                            have also done work
                            with Unbounce Pages, Wordpress, and Bigcommerce. I build the sites from the ground up and
                            manage the asset
                            acquisition and customer interactions for the projects I'm working on. I do a lot of custom
                            code work on the sites that I
                            make, primarily using CSS, HTML, and Liquid. I also edit and create graphics for the brands
                            that I work with.</p>

                        <p>At RideNow Powersports, my focus was on graphic design and social media marketing through
                            email, FaceBook and
                            Instagram. I marketed products by developing and implementing marketing and advertising
                            campaigns. I designed the
                            majority of the in-store promotional material for several different brands and departments,
                            including flyers, posters,
                            videos, and billboard ads.</p>

                        <p>My job as a Marketing Representative was to help promote awareness of certain products and services that Melaleuca,
                            Inc. offers to its customers and non-customers. I had to fully know and be able to promote every service that Melaleuca
                            offered. I also helped the company's business builders to develop a deeper understanding of them as well so they could
                            more effectively grow a business and be successful in meeting their goals.

                        <p>As a salesman at Wackerli and Erickson's, I was trained on the ins and outs of the automotive industry. I was expected to

                            to many people on a daily basis and be able to quickly and accurately determine their wants and needs.
