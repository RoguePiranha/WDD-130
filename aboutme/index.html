            <h2>Education</h2>  
            <p>I'm a junior and just getting back into school this semester! I was a student back in 2015 studying Business Management and had to stop coming to get a job after we had my daughter and needed steady income. I've switched my major since then to Software Engineering and I'm loving it!</p>

            <h2>Family</h2>  
            <p>My wife and I have been married since August 29th, 2014. We met when I was a freshman and she was a missionary serving in my parent's ward in Oregon. I met her over Thanksgiving with my family. We have two amazing kids now, Aria (5) and Grayson (2). We got married in the Chicago temple.</p>

            <h2>Career</h2>  
            <p>In 2019 we moved to Arizona to be closer to my wife's family. I got a job in marketing that transitioned into a web design and development job. I mostly did front-end design on sites like Shopify and Squarespace. That's when I learned I love coding and want to learn more!</p>
